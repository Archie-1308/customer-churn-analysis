HELLO EVERYONE. 

# 📉 Customer Churn Analysis using Python  

## 🧠 Overview
This project analyzes telecom customer data to find patterns behind churn (customers leaving) and predicts which customers are likely to leave.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab

## 📂 Dataset
Dataset: [Telco Customer Churn – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Encoding  
4. Model Training (Logistic Regression)  
5. Insights & Recommendations  

## 📈 Key Insights
- Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate.  
- Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to leave.  
- Loyalty and auto-payment options reduce churn.

## 🤖 Model Performance
- ROC-AUC: ~0.8  
- Good recall for churned customers.

## 💡 Future Work
- Try advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Build a dashboard in Power BI
