# Customer Churn Analysis — Archana Pandey

## Project summary
Analyze telco customer data to discover why customers churn and provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn.

## Dataset
Telco Customer Churn dataset (Kaggle) — includes customer demographics, account information, services, and churn flag.

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)
- Google Colab

## What I did
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) — churn by contract, charges, tenure  
3. Baseline churn classification model (logistic regression)  
4. Visualizations and business recommendations

## Key findings
- Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate.  
- Higher monthly charges are associated with higher churn.  
- Longer tenure correlates with lower churn.

## Recommendations
- Offer discounts or loyalty benefits for month-to-month customers.  
- Introduce targeted retention campaigns for high monthly-charge customers.  
- Incentivize switching to longer-term contracts.

## How to run
Open the notebook `Customer_Churn_Analysis_Archana.ipynb` in Google Colab. Outputs are in `/outputs`.
